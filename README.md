## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamchaarles/Banalyzer.git
cd Banalyzer
```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Dataset Setup

The training dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints. To use this project:

1. Prepare your banana images organized by ripeness category
2. Follow the structure detailed in [DATASET_INFO.md](DATASET_INFO.md)
3. Organize images in the following directory structure:

```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── unripe/
│   ├── ripe/
│   ├── overripe/
│   └── rotten/
└── test/
    ├── unripe_test/
    ├── ripe_test/
    ├── over_ripe_test/
    └── rotten_test/
```

**Dataset Sources:**
- Collect your own banana images at different ripeness stages
- Use public datasets from Kaggle or similar platforms
- Ensure balanced representation across all four categories

---

## 💡 Usage

### 🎓 Training the Model

Train your own model with your dataset:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

**This will:**
- Load and augment your dataset
- Build a MobileNetV2-based transfer learning model
- Train for up to 20 epochs (with early stopping)
- Save the best model to `models/best_model.keras`
- Generate training history plots

**Training time:** 5-15 minutes on modern CPU, 2-5 minutes with GPU

---

### 🔮 Making Predictions

Test the model on individual images using the command line:

```bash
python src/predict.py path/to/your/banana.jpg
```

**Example Output:**

```
============================================================
PREDICTION RESULTS
============================================================

Predicted Class: RIPE
Confidence: 94.32%

All Class Probabilities:
----------------------------------------
unripe      :  2.15% █
ripe        : 94.32% ███████████████████████████████████████████████
overripe    :  3.21% █
rotten      :  0.32% 

============================================================
✓ High confidence prediction
